# Astro Developer Protfolio

At the moment, I'm using this repo for a youtube series on how to build stuff using Astro. I'll be adding more to this repo as I go along.

[The Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLieFqTElnpVy492IgVFSVsafnhsHiDK2W)

This is a barebones starter developer protfolio for Astro.

- Simple layout for developers to make their own portfolio
- Easy to edit data that is coming from the `src/data/` directory
- A simple `AppCards` component that loops over the data
- Responsive design that looks nice on mobile and desktop
- A good foundation to build on using Astro
- Sleek SVG icons for each page
- Active class applied to the current page
